Are you running make -j when this occurs? Perhaps try limiting to one compilation at a time. – Johnsyweb Apr 5 '11 at 9:29

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

Are you running make -j when this occurs? Perhaps try limiting to one compilation at a time. – Johnsyweb Apr 5 '11 at 9:29

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

Are you running make -j when this occurs? Perhaps try limiting to one compilation at a time. – Johnsyweb Apr 5 '11 at 9:29

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?

ETXTBSY is a standard errno value, the best explanation I've found being:

An attempt to execute a file that is currently open for writing, or write to a file that is currently being executed. Often using a debugger to run a program is considered having it open for writing and will cause this error. (The name stands for "text file busy".)

So, you might still be executing the program the compiler is trying to recreate/update...?
